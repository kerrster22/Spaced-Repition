              Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing
              information at gradually increasing intervals of time, rather than
              cramming or reviewing information at fixed intervals. Here are
              some of the benefits of spaced repetition
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved long-term memory retention: Spaced repetition helps in
              retaining information in the long term memory by regularly
              revisiting the concepts. It has been found that this technique
              helps in retaining up to 80% of the information over a longer
              period.
            </li>
            <li>
              Time-efficient learning: Since spaced repetition reduces the
              amount of time you spend studying, you can learn more information
              in less time. This is because you are only revisiting the
              information when it is about to fade from your memory, rather than
              going over it again and again when it is still fresh.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced forgetting: Spaced repetition can reduce the amount of
              forgetting that occurs after learning new information. By
              revisiting the information at the appropriate intervals, it helps
              in preventing the information from slipping away.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increased motivation: Spaced repetition can be motivating as you
              see progress in retaining the information. When you see that you
              are able to recall the information better, it can encourage you to
              continue studying.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enhanced comprehension: Spaced repetition promotes deeper
              understanding and comprehension of the material because it allows
              you to focus on the most important concepts, and reinforces them
              over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Overall, spaced repetition is an effective and efficient technique
              for learning and retaining information over the long term, and can
              be particularly useful for studying languages, scientific
              concepts, and other complex subjects.
